# Listing

Listing app can be found ![here]

Listing app allows a user to search for housing with filtered entries.
The user can choose minimum/maximum bedrooms, minimum/maximum bathrooms,
minimum/maximum square feet, street address, and price range. Mapbox API
is integrated to allow the user to see exactly where the houses are.
Mapbox API uses the geoJSON response sent back from the controller in order
to pinpoint houses. Basic bootstrap was added to allow better user experience.
The data inputted is from
https://s3.amazonaws.com/opendoor-problems/listings.csv
The data had 10000 entries and heroku doesn't allow importing files that
big so the data was imported in batches of 2000 entries. A user can import
more entries into the app by clicking import in the top right but batches
of more than 2000 or so may cause a set timeout to the webapp.



In the future, I would definitely try to include pagination, since 10000
search results definitely stretches the page. I may add more styling so that
there is better user experience.
