# Listing

Listing app can be found [here]

Listing app allows a user to search for housing with filtered entries.
The user can choose minimum/maximum bedrooms, minimum/maximum bathrooms,
minimum/maximum square feet, street address, and price range. The app was built
with Ruby on Rails and javascript AJAX. Mapbox API was integrated to allow the
user to see exactly where the houses are. Mapbox API uses the geoJSON
response sent back from the controller in order to pinpoint houses.
Basic bootstrap/SASS was added to allow better user experience. Furthermore,
kaminari pagination was included along with infinite scroll. The ajax will
fetch the next 10 models and append it to the view. This stopped the screen
from blowing up when a user selects all listings possible.

The data inputted is from
https://s3.amazonaws.com/opendoor-problems/listings.csv
The data had 10000 entries and heroku doesn't allow importing files that
big so the data was imported in batches of 1000 entries. There are currently
9000 entries. Heroku only allows a maximum of 10000 entries in the database for
the basic plan so if a user inputs more than 10000 entries then
the database will being blocking insertion of entries. To import
more entries into the app click the import button in the top right. Batches
of more than 1000 or so may cause a set timeout to the webapp.

Please note that entering a query string into the url will not actually query anything.
I'm using a custom ajax call in order to map and paginate my lists, which only
gets called when you press the Search button.

In the future, I may add more styling so that there is better user experience.
I'm not sure at the moment if there is a faster way to pull data from the
database; however, I will look into it.
